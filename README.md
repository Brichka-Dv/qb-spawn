```
QB.Spawns = {
    ["spawn1"] = { -- Needs to be unique
        coords = vector4(1.1, -1.1, 1.1, 180.0), -- Coords player will be spawned
        location = "spawn1", -- Needs to be unique
        label = "Spawn 1 Name", -- This is the label which will show up in selection menu.
    },
    ["spawn2"] = { -- Needs to be unique
        coords = vector4(1.1, -1.1, 1.1, 180.0), -- Coords player will be spawned
